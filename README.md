```* FrontEnd Coding Challenge```

## Tech Requirements

* ReactJS or Javascript (Vanilla) as programming language;
* CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Bulma, etc..) aren't allowed. We want to know your css skills;
* You can use SASS;
* Use [Marvel developer API](https://developer.marvel.com) as data source;
  * server-side authentication endpoint can be used. But the hash **must** be calculated dynamically. To do that, please take a look at the [documentation](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/authorization) in ***Authentication for Server-Side Application*** session to know how to generate the hash.
* Fork this repository to your own workspace and submit a new pull request when you have all done. 
    * If you have any problems to do a pull request, zip your local workspace folder (including the .git folder) and send to us by [email (jobs@b8one.com)](mailto:jobs@b8one.com)
    * ***Don't forget to fill the pull_request_template.md file with your informations***

## The Challenge

Build a SPA (Single Page Application) to list all heroes related to a given event name *(Allowing input a list of events should be a plus)* .

User should filter by:
  * Hero name
  * Comic name

User should order by:
  * Event date
  * Comic name
  * Hero name

The list should be paginated by default 20 itens by page and have a default order (descending) by event date.

*An event detail page should be a plus.*

## Validation checklist 
1. **Coding organization & best practices** - Semantic elements, be conscious of page speed, DRY code (code density), coding modularization and good code documentation (jsDoc).
2. **How do you think** - Talk through your thought process and your approach to problems and solutions. For example, why did you choose vanilla (pure Javascript) instead of ReactJS?? or SASS rather than pure CSS. Let us know the CSS methodology did you've use and why. Add all information resumed at the README file.
3. **Vulnerability** - Did you found any vulnerability?? Let us know and tell us how to fix it.
4. **Solution** - Didn't finish all requirements? No problem, tell us why. Add this information resumed at README file.
4. **Test** - We don't need full cover.

## DeadLine
**You have 4 days to send to us your solution since the date you've received this link.**

## Questions
Please let us know if you have any question! Send to us specific questions if you need more clarification about the challenge.
